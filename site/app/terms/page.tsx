        Terms of Use
      </h1>

      <h2>The agreement</h2>
      <p>
        OnlyDM is provided by {operator} (“OnlyDM”, “we”, “us”). On iPhone, OnlyDM is licensed to you under Apple’s{' '}
        <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/" {...ext}>
          Standard End User License Agreement
        </a>
        , which these terms supplement. On Android, Google Play’s terms apply alongside these. By using OnlyDM you agree to
        both.
      </p>

      <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
      <p>OnlyDM is a paid app with auto-renewable subscriptions, billed and managed by Apple or Google through your store account:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Monthly: $3.99 a month (₹299 in India).</li>
        <li>Yearly: $14.99 a year (₹999 in India), with a {site.trialDays}-day free trial for new subscribers.</li>
        <li>
          Prices are shown in your local currency before you buy and may differ by country. With a free trial you are
          charged when it ends, unless you cancel before.
        </li>
        <li>
          All plans renew automatically until cancelled: on iPhone in Settings › your name › Subscriptions, on Android in
          Google Play › Payments and subscriptions. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period.
          Deleting the app does not cancel a subscription.
        </li>
        <li>
          A subscription unlocks OnlyDM on any device signed in to the same Apple ID or Google account. Use Restore
          Purchases in the app after a reinstall.
        </li>
        <li>
          Refunds are handled by Apple through{' '}
          <a href="https://reportaproblem.apple.com/" {...ext}>
            reportaproblem.apple.com
          </a>{' '}
          and by Google under{' '}
          <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2479637" {...ext}>
            Google Play’s refund policy
          </a>
          .
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Instagram and Meta</h2>
      <p>
        OnlyDM is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Instagram, Threads, Facebook or Meta Platforms, Inc. You
        need your own accounts, and your use of them inside OnlyDM remains governed by their own terms. OnlyDM shows their
        websites with the feed, Reels and Explore hidden; they may change their sites in ways that affect OnlyDM at any time.
      </p>

      <h2>Using OnlyDM</h2>
      <p>
        You must be at least 13, and old enough to use these platforms where you live. Don’t use OnlyDM to break the law or
        another service’s rules, or to copy, resell, reverse engineer or disrupt the app. The OnlyDM name, logo and app
        belong to us; content on the platforms belongs to its owners.
      </p>

      <h2>No warranty</h2>
      <p>
        OnlyDM is provided as is, without warranty of any kind. We are not liable for anything Instagram (or Threads or Facebook, if you add them)
        do to your account, for messages you send or receive, or for interruptions caused by changes to their websites. As
        far as the law allows, our total liability to you is limited to what you paid for OnlyDM in the 12 months before a
        claim. Nothing here limits rights you have under consumer law that can’t be excluded.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these terms. We’ll change the date at the top and tell you in the app about important changes before
        they apply.
